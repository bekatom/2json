NOTE    NIST SQL Test Suite, V6.0, Pseudo-Shell, runsch.all
NOTE      This file lists all the schema files to be run for three different
NOTE        scenarios (schema warning, schema error, no create schema statement)
NOTE      Identified by file name schem*.*, cts5sch*.*, or xschem*.*
NOTE      Authorization id is shown after the file name
NOTE ***********************************************************************

NOTE     X/Open Profile files XSCHEMA*.SQL are not applicable to FIPS 127-2.
NOTE     Integrity Enhancement Files are optional for X/Open Profiles.

NOTE     Review the three pseudo-shells below and choose one, as appropriate:
NOTE     #1  Schema Warning on Access Rule Violation
NOTE     #2  Schema Error on Access Rule Violation
NOTE     #3  Create Schema Statement Not Supported

NOTE     Remove schemas for features not supported (e.g. Intermediate SQL)


NOTE     #1
NOTE     Schema Warning on Access Rule Violation:
NOTE       This is a valid FIPS 127-2 method of schema creation.
NOTE       Some schemas contain privilege violations.
NOTE       Use this sequence if warnings are issued for unprivileged grants,
NOTE         and schemas are created ignoring the unprivileged grants.

NOTE     #2
NOTE     Schema Error on Access Rule Violation:
NOTE       This is a valid FIPS 127-2 method of schema creation.
NOTE       Some schemas contain privilege violations.
NOTE       Use this sequence if fatal errors are issued for unprivileged grants,
NOTE         and schemas will not be created due to the unprivileged grants.
NOTE       For each schem*.pv* file, a fatal error must occur, and the schema
NOTE         must fail to create.  Each schem*.pv* contains an unprivileged
NOTE         grant.  After each schem*.pv* file has been rejected, the file
NOTE         schem*.ok (with all unprivileged grants removed) may be executed.

NOTE     #3
NOTE     Create Schema Statement Not Supported:
NOTE       This is not a valid FIPS 127-2 method of schema creation,
NOTE         but is provided to assist evaluating SQL implementations
NOTE         which do not support the required CREATE SCHEMA statement.
NOTE       This IS a valid X/Open Profiles method of schema creation.
NOTE       Some schemas contain privilege violations, but since each
NOTE         unprivileged grant is an independent SQL statement, it will
NOTE         be rejected without affecting other SQL statements, so
NOTE         no special processing is required.
