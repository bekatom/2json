This instruction applies ONLY to X/Open Profile testing!


The files for X/Open testing in the schema directory are:


    xdrop1.sql     a command file to drop tables in xschema1 -- for restart
    xdrop2.sql     a command file to drop tables in xschema2 -- for restart
    xrecre1.nc     a command file to restart the program series xop719-xop723
    xschema1.nc    alternate form of xschema1.smi
    xschema1.smi   SCHEMA for user XOPEN1 (run this one first)
    xschema2.smi   SCHEMA for user XOPEN2 (run this second)

CAVEAT:
Establish a procedure to drop the database or tables and restart.
The programs in this testing profile do schema manipulation and are
designed to be run in STRICT NUERICAL ORDER, after schema creation and
data load.  You cannot simply rerun a failed program, in order to better
debug it.  You will need to reestablish the base environment.

A few shortcuts are available, however:
Every test except the xop720-xop723 sequence may be run immediately
after recreating the schemas and reloading data.  (xop720-xop723 must be
run immediately after xop719)
------------------------------------------------------
To run the tests, create three database users:  XOPEN1, XOPEN2, and XOPEN3.
Then, create the schemas, according to RUNSCH.XOP
